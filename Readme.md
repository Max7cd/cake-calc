# About
Website to calculate factor for ingredients when baking cakes from recipes using a differently sized mold.
Simply provide the shape and size of the cake given in the recipe and the size of mold you want to use to bake.
Supports conversion between different types of molds.

It is currently hosted on [https://www.max7cd.de/cake.html](https://www.max7cd.de/cake.html)

# Roadmap
 - Add the option to switch between toppings and batter mode. Currently only respects the volume, but toppings usually scale with the area of the top surface.
 - Add an advanced mode for ring molds, since they have many parameters to accurately calculate their volume and surface area.
